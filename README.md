## Approach
- We implemented our learnings from the previous modules to date: EDA, Git and data handling
- We were given a huge data set and we set off by understanding the data and what would make sense to achieve the outcome
- We made informed decisions on what data to keep, what to drop, what to impute and what to clean up.
- We analyzed this modified dataset to observe patterns and eventually make recommendations.

## Analysis
- The loan officer should show better diligence in verifying loans
- He/ she should stick to the rules of the grades defined by Lending Club. For instance, do not give loans beyond 75% of the grade value for people on Rent or having mortgages on their properties
- If the investors are not covering the loan entirely, increase the loan rate by a few percentage points, maybe 2-5 pp.
